# Sandbox Site

This site has two main purposes for existing:

1. To provide a place to showcase any web apps I have built as personal projects
2. To be a sandbox for me to experiment with whatever web dev libraries and frameworks I'm interested in either learning or improving my use of

## Sections

**NOTE:** At the time of the initial writing of this README, nothing is live yet. As each section goes live on the site, it will have a checkmark near its heading.

### Apps

The main page of this section will link to all of my completed and in-development web apps. Different apps may be built with different libraries or techniques, and I will try to include some sort of explanation for anyone wanting to see what different tools are capable of

### Code

I've recently discovered how to use BASH scripting to simplify/streamline a lot of my frequently-performed tasks at work (I'm a web developer), and so I plan to use this section to showcase some useful BASH scripts I use, as well as use it as an excuse to keep playing with the shell and hopefully create some cool snippets of code. This may also potentially become a place to publish any useful code I write in any other language.

### Blog

I currently have no plans to use this section for any kind of regularly scheduled posts, but if I ever have any thoughts that I would like to share (especially tech-related ones), this is where they will be posted. I haven't finalized how I'd like to provide explanations for my apps in the Apps section, but this section is a possible place to find those as well, depending on what I ultimately decide on.

### About

This section will be for any general information about myself that I feel like sharing. Probably mostly things that are relevant to web development and programming in general (which is one of my biggest passions), but I also may decide to include other random tidbits if I feel like it.

## About the site

This site is being built with a mostly `NodeJS` based codebase. I plan to use `EJS` for `HTML` templating, `Stylus` for `CSS` preprocessing, `ExpressJS` for routing, and will no doubt find other useful libraries as I finish planning and building the site. I will add a full list of all tools used on this site when I have a working version live.

All content, unless otherwise noted, will be authored by me (Ethan Stewart). If you for some reason feel like cloning or forking it to remove my content and make it your own, or play with some of my functionality to see if you can make it better, make sure you have the current version of `Node` and `npm` (I plan to use the most up-to-date versions whenever possible, and will be doing my best to check at least once a month for whether updates are needed)
